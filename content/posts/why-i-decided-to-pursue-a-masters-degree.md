As long as I can remember, I have always felt that the way to freedom is through knowledge, and knowledge is gained through education. To me, knowledge means freedom. I strive to be free.

But why exactly did I want to get a master's degree?

I was not satisfied with what I knew. 

During my sophomore year, I became interested in the field Artificial Intelligence - that's when I decided I wanted to pursue a career in it. I didn't yet have the formal knowledge needed to be successful in this field, and I was at a point in my career where things were moving so fast, but not in a way that I could control. I knew there was a gap in my knowledge, and if I didn't do something about it, I might never be truly happy with myself. So I decided to pursue a Master's degree abroad, which I thought could give me the rigor I needed. A structured environment like the university forces you to learn. You don't have the luxury of procrastinating, at least not forever. At some point, you become comfortable with being a student of life and dedicating your life's journey to learning and perfecting your art. At least, that's how it is for me. I'm very glad I decided to pursue a Master's degree because I've learned a lot of new things in the last 1 year. My understanding of technical subfields has broadened and I'm already looking forward to my PhD : ))

Until next time,
