                <div>Oh hello! My name is Tejumade Afonja and I am a master's student at Saarland University. 
		First of all, thank you for visiting, but while you're here, 
		I'd like to invite you to participate in a <a href="bit.ly/accent_influence" target="_blank">short anonymous survey</a>  
		I'm conducting to understand the effects of accent on learning. 
		It will take about 2-5 minutes to complete, and I would very much appreciate your participation. 
		If you can also share the survey with your network, that's even more awesome. Thank you so much!

		Last summer, I had the opportunity to intern remotely with <a href="https://www.papernot.fr/" target="_blank">Prof. Nicolas Papernot</a>
		at the University of Toronto and Vector Institute where I
		investigated the security of speaker classification models, specifically, I worked on generative model extraction
		of speaker classification models.
		I also recently joined 
		<a href="https://cispa.saarland/group/fritz/" target="_blank">Prof. Mario Fritz</a>'s lab as a research assitant investigating the effectiveness
		of synthetic tabular data as a subsitute for real data.

		In 2018, I co-founded <a href="http://www.aisaturdayslagos.com/" target="_blank">AI Saturdays Lagos</a>, 
		an artificial intelligence community based in Lagos, Nigeria, 
		where we offer free classes on Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning for about 12 - 16 weeks 
		(classes are on Saturdays) through structured learning groups. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have moved our classes online.

                    I've always been passionate and fascinated about Artificial Intelligence (AI) for 
                    as long as I can remember and I believe that AI has potential to improve life without 
                    opening up or exacerbate inequalities but to achieve this, locations in 
                    which AI is done will have to be widened and ambitious goals to democratize AI education 
                    will need to be set. Doing so will allow a broader audience to discuss and contribute to 
                    the success of an AI-enabled world. My team and I are focused on bridging this gap of 
                    Artificial Intelligence in Nigeria through our AI Saturdays Classes.
